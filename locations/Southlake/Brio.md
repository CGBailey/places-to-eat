“An extensive menu” of “upscale” Italian cuisine (served with “to-die-for” bread) pleases palates at these “frequently packed” chain members in Allen, boasting a “spartan, modern” aesthetic, and Southlake, with a “more open and airy” feel; they’re favored spots for “special occasions”, with both locations offering patio dining, which “always adds to the experience.”
